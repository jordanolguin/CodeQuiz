# CodeQuiz

This is a Code Quiz Challenge to test user's knowledge of coding principles.

## Usage

Click on the link (https://jordanolguin.github.io/CodeQuiz/) to open the game in your browser. Upon page load, user may click on the "Start" button to begin the game, or click on "High Scores" to view the initials and scores of past attempts and users. Once the game is started, a time will appear in the top right corner, counting down from 75 seconds. Every wrong answer will subtract 10 seconds from the clock, until the timer runs out, or the time left is less than 10 seconds. The remaining time will be shown on the scores page with an input area to enter user's initials. Clicking on the "High Scores" or clicking "Submit" will send user to the highscores page. Only selecting the correct answer will move onto the next question until the questions and/or time runs out. User will have unlimited attempts to select the correct answer.

## Functionality

The game questions were created dynamically with JavaScript, so that this application can be updated with new questions. Please refer to the script.js file.
